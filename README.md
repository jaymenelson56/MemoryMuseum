## Memory Museum

Time passes by pretty quickly. Sometimes it's nice to go back and see what things were like back then. Thanks to this app, you can create your own time capsule/memory page for everyone to view and populate the exhibit with items for everyone to see. If you have an item that you think would go better in another users exhibit you can also give them that item for their exhibit. Neat! As a registered user you can...

* View the various exhibits
* View the various items within the exhibit
* Create their own exhibit
* Delete their own exhibits
* Upload their own items
* Edit their own items
* Delete their own Items
* Rate other users Exhibits
* View the average rating of my exhibit
